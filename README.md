# Data Structures and Algorithms
This is a repository for learning and implementing different data structures and algorithms! We will provide information about our project soon...

# Idea
One of the best way to learn data structures and algorithms is to implement them and see how they actually work in action.
The idea of our project is to offer this opportunity and dive into this complex, yet extremely interesting sphere!

# Cloning a repository
**Make sure you have [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed.**

Now it is time to clone this repository. There are several variants to do it. Chose one (of two) that is the most suitable for you:
- Use [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/). The most simple way, but not very powerful.

- Or you can perform usual repository clone

    1. Open (or download and install) [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) Bash.

    1. Change your current working directory to the location where the repository will be cloned:
        ```console
        cd "path_to_clone_this_repository"
        ```
    1. Type and execute:
        ```console
            git clone https://github.com/Software-Engineering-Learning-Team/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms.git
        ```

# Git GUI clients
If you do not want to work with git from your console - you definitely can use you favorite git GUI client. For example, one of the following:
- [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
- [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/)
- [Sourcetree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/)
- Your own favorite git GUI client

# Useful tips
We strongly suggest you to read about [SSH](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh) and [PGP](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification) and use them. If you've never used them before, now is the time to start.
